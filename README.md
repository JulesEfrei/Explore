# Modern carousel template
## Width Swipper.js & anime.js

Make a modern and animate carousel with this template. (Responsive)

### Demo : 
- Clone the git repository with the command bellow :

```bash
mkdir Explore
cd Explore
git clone https://github.com/JulesEfrei/Explore.git
```
- Next, open the html file and enjoy it !

### Why does this files ?

- `index.html` : Core of the Web page
- `style.scss` : Style of the index.html (Using Sass)
- `style.css.map` : map of the css (Creating when scss file is compiled)
- `anime.min.js` : Import of anime.js library
- `main.js` : main JavaScript code
- `Font folder` : Import external font

### Why Javascript & Sass

I'm using Sass by default in all my front-end project for these features. Of course, you can understand all the project without a knoledge of Sass (Sass is a css tools). Then JavaScript is a basic for all moderne and dynamique website for the aniation and the flexibility with the DOM. 

## Getting Started

### Download

Start by clone the repository in your project :

```bash
cd "your_project"
mkdir template; cd template
git clone https://github.com/JulesEfrei/Explore.git
```

Now download the anime.js depencies

```bash
npm install anime.js --save
```

### File include

Link `anime.min.js` and Swipper import in your `HTML` file :

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.js"></script>
<script src="./assets/js/anime.min.js"></script>
```

Then create a `main.js` file in your project and include it in your `HTML` :

```bash
touch main.js
```

```html
<script src="./assets/js/main.js"></script>
```
# How to use & modify the template

As see before, you can import externals fonts. Just place your font in the right folder. Or, you can import Goggle font and link it to the `html` file. 
If you don't use Sass in your project, you can remove the `styles.scss`& `style.css.map` files and modify style in the classic `styles.css`file.

## Carousel with Swiper

As you can see in the `html`there are a section `#slider`. It matches to the carousel.

```html
<section id="slider">
        <!-- required div -->
        <div class="swiper-container">
            <div class="swiper-wrapper">
        <!-- 01 -->
                <div class="swiper-slide">
                    <div class="left mercure"></div>
                    <div class="planet_text_container">
                        <H1 class="title">MERCURY</H1>
                        <p class="resume">
                            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun but, perhaps
                            surprisingly, it does not have the highest temperatures. It is
                            the second densest planet of the Solar System, but also the
                            smallest planet. The structure of Mercury makes it the most
                            similar planet to Earth.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="anim_text_list">
                            <li>ORBIT PERIOD: 87.97 Earth days</li>
                            <li>KNOWNS MOONS : None</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
        <!-- 02 -->
                <div class="swiper-slide">
                    <div class="left venus"></div>
                    <div class="planet_text_container">
                        <H1 class="title">VENUS</H1>
                        <p class="resume">
                            Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the
                            sixth-largest. Together with Mercury, they are the only
                            planets without a satellite, even though Mercury is closer to
                            the sun, Venus is the hottest planet.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="anim_text_list">
                            <li>ORBIT PERIOD: 224.70 Earth days</li>
                            <li>KNOWNS MOONS : None</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
        <!-- required div -->
            </div>
            <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
        </div>
    </section>
```

There are a lot of information here but we just need to remember that you musn't remove the `swiper-container` div and these `swiper-slide` container to. Then, don't remove the `swiper-paganitaion`div. 
You can modify all the content inside the `.swipper-slide`container. Each of these conatiner is a slide. In this template, you already have an image on the left of the slide and at the right, a text / descrirption section.

INSERT SCREENSHOT

NB : my `swpier-pagination` is empty. You will modify the value directly in JavaScript but you can add them in the html file if you prefer.

In the `main.js` file, there is a instance of Swiper. It take on argument the `.swiper-container` (I told you.. Don't remove this container) and an object with the options of your carousel.

```js
var slider = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
    loop: true,
    spaceBetween: 200, 
    pagination:{
        el: ".swiper-pagination",
        clickable: true,
        renderBullet: function(index, className) {
            return '<div class="' + className + '">' + keys[index] + "</div>";
        }
    }
});
```

Here is the list the options :

- **loop** : *boolean*. Allow the loop in the carousel. When we slide on the last slide, the first slide follow.
- **spaceBetween** : *number*. Set the space between slide.
- **pagination** : *object*. Customize the control on our carousel.
    - **el** : *css class*. Set the pagination container.
    - **clickable** : *boolean*. If true, we can navigate with the pagination.
    - **renderBullet** : *function*. It take on arguments an index and a class name for the style in css. This function create all pagination items we need from the array `keys`

So, there is the `keys` array in `main.js` :

```js
var keys = [
    "Mercury",
    "Venus",
    "Earth",
    "Mars",
    "Jupiter",
    "Saturn",
    "Uranus",
    "Neptune"
  ];
```

Modify this array with your own pagination. You can also modify the options of the carousel.
More information about Swiper in their [documentation](https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api)

## Add animation on the carousel with anime.js

In Swiper, there is a method called `slideChangeTransitionStart` that we use to set actions on a change of slide. We're adding the animation with this method. For the animations, we're using the `anime.js` library. It work very easy, here is the [documentation](https://animejs.com/documentation/) of it. By default in this template, there are tiny animation of each element in slides when the slide change and a loop animation of the image. You can modify and/or remove all of them and create your own.

### How works anime.js

In our `main.js`, we simply use the anime function and set the animation with all property as you can see in the doc.

```js
anime({
        targets: '.title', 
        translateX: [500, 0],
        opacity: [0, 1],
        easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, 10)',
        duration: 2000
    });
```

```diff
! The targets key is required. It takes on value the class (or id) of the element in HTML 
```
Then, there are other option for our animation. 
Here we have a translateX from x = 500 to x = 0,
an opacity from 0 to 1,
an easing and the duration of the animation.

So in the template, we finally have these animations :
```js
slider.on('slideChangeTransitionStart', function(){
    anime({
        targets: '.title', 
        translateX: [500, 0],
        opacity: [0, 1],
        easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, 10)',
        duration: 2000
    });
    anime({
        targets: '.resume', 
        translateX: [250, 0],
        opacity: [0, 1],
        delay: 300,
        easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, 10)',
        duration: 2000
    });
    anime({
        targets: '.anim_text_list', 
        translateY: [250, 0],
        opacity: [0, 1],
        easing: 'easeOutElastic(1, 10)',
        duration: 2000
    });
});
```
